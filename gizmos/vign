 help "Gizmo for creating physically plausible vignetting.\n\nThis node should allow for plenty of artistic adjustments, but is mainly intended to facilitate in matching the vignetting of photographical images. It applies an adjudstable cosine power law of illumination falloff to simulate the vignetting of light intensities at the backplate of the camera.\n\nWill match <b>natural vignetting</b> quite wit the <i>Cosine Power</i> set to 4, but can be tweaked to better simulate <b>optical</b> and <b>pixel vignetting</b> as well.\n\n<b>Natural vignetting</b> is due to both the reduced facing ratio of the light towards the edges of the image plane, but also the longer distance from the aperture.\n<b>Optical vignetting</b> is caused by light fallof in the lens array, and will depend on the f-stop.\n<b>Pixel vignetting</b> is only present in images captured by digital sensors, and is due to the photocytes being partly occluded by their photon wells.\n\nMade by Andreas Bravin Karlsson at Ego Studios."
